# Snakemake Pipeline Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to run the differential co-expression pipeline using Snakemake
(`src/pipelines/Snakefile_bootstrap`). Snakemake manages job dependencies, parallelism,
and incremental re-runs automatically, making it the preferred method over the manual bash
script for most use cases.

---

## Prerequisites

- Snakemake ≥ 7.0 installed (`conda install -c bioconda snakemake`)
- Python dependencies installed (h5py, numpy, scipy)
- Expression data as TSV or HDF5

---

## Configuration

All pipeline parameters are set in a YAML config file. Two example configs are provided:

| Config | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `config/ct_voom_snakemake.yaml` | Control (ct_voom), 15-gene subset for testing |
| `config/hs_voom_snakemake.yaml` | Heat-shock (hs_voom), full production run |

### Complete Config Reference

```yaml
# --- Input (provide one of the three) ---
expr_tsv: "dataset/processed/VOOM/voomdataCtrl.txt"  # TSV → auto-converted to HDF5
expr_h5:  "results/expression.h5"                    # existing HDF5, skips conversion
# toy: true                                           # built-in synthetic data

# --- Output ---
out_dir: "results_ct_voom"   # all outputs written here

# --- Bootstrap parameters ---
low_frac:       0.2     # fraction of samples in LOW expression group
high_frac:      0.2     # fraction of samples in HIGH expression group
n_bootstrap:    1000    # number of bootstrap resamples
bootstrap_frac: 0.8     # fraction of group used per resample
seed:           42      # random seed for reproducibility
batch_size:     null    # null = vectorized (fast, ~30 GB RAM);
                        # integer = batch mode (slower, ~12 GB RAM)

# --- Significance ---
fdr_alpha:      0.7               # FDR threshold for edge significance
edge_selection: "sig_differential" # "sig_differential" or "sig_edges"
no_ci_filter:   false             # false = require CI to exclude zero (default)

# --- Storage ---
storage_mode: "common"   # "common" (default), "minimal", or "full"
                         # see OPTIMIZATION-02-Storage.md

# --- Thresholds (Stage 3) ---
min_effect:      0.0    # minimum |Δr| to retain an edge
corr_threshold:  0.0001 # minimum |r| to count as "present"
annotate:        false  # true = annotate output TSV with gene symbols (requires R)

# --- Optional stages ---
skip_visualization:  true  # false = run Stage 5 (visualization export)

# --- Stage 4: Focus gene topology ---
# Set skip_focus_topology: false to enable.
# Requires Stage 3 (reconstruct_single) to complete for all relevant genes first.
skip_focus_topology: true
focus_genes: "top:50"    # "top:N", "0,1,2,...", or "range:start:end"
focus_n_jobs: 4          # parallel workers for Stage 4

# --- Gene subset (optional) ---
# Restrict per-gene jobs (Stages 2a, 2b, 3, 3b, 4) to a named subset of genes.
# Stages 0 and 1 always process the full expression matrix.
# Remove gene_subset (or set to []) to process all genes.
gene_subset:
  - FBgn0002563
  - FBgn0027844
```

## Running the Pipeline

### Dry run (always do this first)

```bash
snakemake -s src/pipelines/Snakefile_bootstrap \
    --configfile config/ct_voom_snakemake.yaml \
    -n
```

> **Note on checkpoint behaviour:** The dry run will show only a small number of jobs
> (`preprocess`, `collect_networks`, `all`) even when dozens of per-gene jobs will run.
> This is expected — Snakemake cannot enumerate per-gene Stage 2a/2b/3 jobs until the
> `preprocess` checkpoint completes and `expression.h5` is created. All stages will
> execute correctly in a real run.

### Full run from scratch (new output folder)

```bash
snakemake -s src/pipelines/Snakefile_bootstrap \
    --configfile config/ct_voom_snakemake.yaml \
    --config out_dir=results_ct_voom_v2 \
    -j 15
```

### Re-run only Stage 3b collection (existing intermediate files)

```bash
snakemake -s src/pipelines/Snakefile_bootstrap \
    --configfile config/ct_voom_snakemake.yaml \
    --forcerun collect_networks \
    -j 1
```

### Run only through Stage 2b (gene subset testing)

```bash
snakemake -s src/pipelines/Snakefile_bootstrap \
    --configfile config/ct_voom_snakemake.yaml \
    --until bootstrap_significant \
    -j 15
```

### Run through Stage 3 including Stage 4 (focus gene topology)

```bash
snakemake -s src/pipelines/Snakefile_bootstrap \
    --configfile config/ct_voom_snakemake.yaml \
    --config skip_focus_topology=false \
    -j 15
```

### Override config values on the command line

```bash
# Run with a new output folder and a different storage mode
snakemake -s src/pipelines/Snakefile_bootstrap \
    --configfile config/ct_voom_snakemake.yaml \
    --config out_dir=results_new storage_mode=minimal annotate=true \
    -j 15
```

        │
        └── [Stage 5: visualization, if skip_visualization: false]
            → visualization_data/
```

### Why Stage 2 shows as a checkpoint

`preprocess` is a Snakemake **checkpoint** because the number and names of per-gene jobs
in Stages 2a, 2b, and 3 depend on the gene names inside `expression.h5`. Snakemake cannot
know how many `{gi}_{gene_id}` targets to create until the file exists. Once `preprocess`
completes, the DAG is re-evaluated and all per-gene jobs are scheduled automatically.

---

## Gene Subset Filtering

Setting `gene_subset` in the config restricts per-gene jobs to only the named genes:

```yaml
gene_subset:
  - FBgn0002563
  - FBgn0027844
```

**Which stages are affected:**

| Stage | Subset filtering |
|-------|-----------------|
| Stage 0 (preprocess) | Always runs on full data |
| Stage 1 (bootstrap_indices) | Always runs on full data |
| Stage 2a (base_correlations) | ✅ Only subset genes scheduled |
| Stage 2b (bootstrap_significant) | ✅ Only subset genes scheduled |
| Stage 3 (reconstruct_single) | ✅ Only subset genes scheduled |
| Stage 3b (collect_networks) | ✅ Reads only existing per-gene files |
| Stage 4 (collect_focus_topology) | ✅ Reads only existing per-gene files |
| Stage 5 (visualization) | Reads aggregated summary, unaffected |

This uses the `_filter_genes()` function and Snakemake's **checkpoint + aggregate input**
pattern: each downstream stage's input is resolved dynamically from the gene names in
`expression.h5`, filtered by `GENE_SUBSET`. Only files whose gene IDs are in the subset
are ever requested, so Snakemake never schedules jobs for excluded genes.

Remove `gene_subset` (or set to `[]`) to process all genes.

## Stage Descriptions

### Stage 0 — Preprocess

Converts expression TSV to HDF5, or generates toy data.
- **Script:** `src/scripts/00preprocess/00convert_expr_to_hdf5.py`
- **Output:** `{out_dir}/expression.h5`
- **Triggered by:** `expr_tsv`, `expr_h5`, or `toy: true` in config

### Stage 1 — Bootstrap Indices

Partitions samples into LOW/HIGH groups and generates bootstrap resamples.
- **Script:** `src/scripts/01subset/01get_extreme_pop_bootstrap.py`
- **Output:** `{out_dir}/bootstrap_indices.h5`
- **Key params:** `low_frac`, `high_frac`, `n_bootstrap`, `bootstrap_frac`, `seed`, `batch_size`

### Stage 2a — Base Correlations (per gene, array job)

Computes Spearman correlations for each reference gene's LOW/HIGH subsets with FDR correction.
- **Script:** `src/scripts/10spearman_corr/02a_calc_base_correlations.py`
- **Output:** `{out_dir}/base_correlations/{gi}_{gene_id}.h5` (one per gene)
- **Key params:** `fdr_alpha`, `storage_mode`

### Stage 2b — Bootstrap Significant Edges (per gene, array job)

Bootstraps only the significant edges identified in Stage 2a (~100× speedup).
- **Script:** `src/scripts/10spearman_corr/02b_bootstrap_significant_edges.py`
- **Output:** `{out_dir}/bootstrap_significant/{gi}_{gene_id}.h5` (one per gene)
- **Key params:** `edge_selection`, `storage_mode`

### Stage 3 — Reconstruct Single Network (per gene, array job)

Reconstructs the full differential network for each reference gene: qualitative edge
classification, global topology (LOW/HIGH/DIFF networks with degree distributions), and
focus gene neighborhood analysis (L1/L2 partners with connectivity metrics).
- **Script:** `src/scripts/10spearman_corr/03_reconstruct_diff_network.py`
- **Output:** `{out_dir}/networks/{gi}_{gene_id}.h5` (one per gene, ~4 GB RAM per job)
- **Key params:** `edge_selection`, `min_effect`, `corr_threshold`, `no_ci_filter`
- **Note:** Scheduled as one Snakemake job per gene (like Stages 2a/2b), enabling native
  Snakemake parallelism across a cluster.

### Stage 3b — Collect Networks (single job)

Aggregates per-gene network files from Stage 3 into a summary HDF5 and the
`rewiring_hubs.tsv` ranking table. Reads from `networks/` (Stage 3 output).
- **Script:** `src/scripts/10spearman_corr/03b_collect_networks.py`
- **Output:** `{out_dir}/differential_network_summary.h5`, `{out_dir}/rewiring_hubs.tsv`
- **Key params:** `annotate`
- **Fallback mode:** Can also read raw `--base-dir`/`--boot-dir` directly (standalone use
  without running Stage 3 first).

### Stage 4 — Focus Gene Topology (optional)

Collects per-gene topology matrices (degree_low, degree_high, degree_diff) and L1/L2
metrics across all reference gene contexts for a selected set of focus genes.
- **Script:** `src/scripts/10spearman_corr/04_collect_focus_gene_topology.py`
- **Output:** `{out_dir}/focus_gene_topology.h5`
- **Enable with:** `skip_focus_topology: false` in config
- **Key params:** `focus_genes` ("top:N", "0,1,2,...", or "range:start:end"), `focus_n_jobs`

### Stage 5 — Visualization Export (optional)

Exports the differential network to TSV and GraphML files for R/Cytoscape visualization.
- **Script:** `src/scripts/10spearman_corr/05_prepare_visualization_data.py`
- **Output:** `{out_dir}/visualization_data/`
- **Enable with:** `skip_visualization: false` in config

## Troubleshooting

### Dry run shows only a few jobs

Expected. See [checkpoint behaviour note](#dry-run-always-do-this-first) above.

### "Nothing to be done" on re-run

All output files already exist. To force a specific stage:
```bash
snakemake ... --forcerun collect_networks -j 1
```
To force everything from scratch in a new directory:
```bash
snakemake ... --config out_dir=results_new -j 15
```

### Stage 3b fails with KeyError / missing metrics

Likely a stale `networks/` file from a previous version. Re-run Stage 3:
```bash
snakemake ... --forcerun reconstruct_single -j 15
```

### storage_mode: "common" not recognised

Check that `02a_calc_base_correlations.py` and `02b_bootstrap_significant_edges.py`
support `"common"` as a valid `--storage-mode` value.
See [OPTIMIZATION-02-Storage.md](OPTIMIZATION-02-Storage.md) for storage mode details.
